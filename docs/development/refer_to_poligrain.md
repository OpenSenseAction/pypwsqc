# Refer to `poligrain` docs

The development workflow is the same as in
[`poligrain`](https://github.com/OpenSenseAction/poligrain). Hence, for now,
please refer to the docs there

- [Contributing](https://poligrain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/CONTRIBUTING.html)
  (note that you have to adjust the URLs to point to this repo instead of the
  repo of `poligrain`)
- [Tools for automation](https://poligrain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/automation.html)

Once the docs are not that much WIP, we can duplicated the doc pages for the
development workflow, but for now it does not makes sense to have them two times
and adjust them two times.
